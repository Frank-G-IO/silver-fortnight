		<h1 class="display-6 text-center text-decoration-underline mt-1">MEET JOCELYN</h1>
		<p class="text-break fw-normal">From an early age, public service has been a part of Mayor Jocelyn Yow’s life and a source of growth and inspiration. Growing up, her parents emphasized the importance of community service and would bring her along to Lions’ Club community service events. Yow also joined the Girl Guides (Girl Scouts) program in high school, where she continued to serve her community.</p>
		<p class="text-break fw-normal">In 2011, a year after the city's incorporation, Yow moved to the Inland Empire and settled in Eastvale, where she quickly found a home. </p>
		<p class="text-break fw-normal">Yow is currently the policy manager for IGNITE, a national nonprofit to elect more women to positions of power. In her previous roles as a district representative for the California State Senate and an aide for Congress, she helped seniors and families access valuable government services, such as retrieving payments from Social Security, as they navigate the complexities of our government. She worked with various federal agencies such as United States Postal Service (USPS) in combatting mail theft. She has also provided support to small businesses and nonprofit organizations by assisting them in obtaining additional federal grants. She helped reunite families and assisted youth from all backgrounds in continuing their pursuit of education. </p>
		<p class="text-break fw-normal">Coming from a family with multiple small businesses, she has learned a great deal about balancing budget and effective logistics management. As an advocate for community safety, she has volunteered to serve as a neighborhood watch captain, ensuring the safety of our families. Committed to enhancing the quality of life of our residents, she initiated the process of implementing Friends of the Library in Eastvale to provide additional revenue for our own library.</p>
		<p class="text-break fw-normal">Jocelyn is pursuing her master's degree at Harvard Extension. She is an alumna of Norco College, where she served as student body president. With home close to her heart, she transferred to the University of California, Berkeley to obtain her bachelor's degree, where she examined various human rights issues such as domestic human trafficking issues and sexual assault on campuses. </p>
		<p class="text-break fw-normal">No matter where life took her, she has always known that Eastvale is where she wants to live and raise her family.</p>
		<p class="text-break fw-normal">“I've been proud to call Eastvale my home ever since my family moved here a decade ago. We are a city on the rise, and the city has an opportunity to grow and provide more for its residents. Serving on the Eastvale City Council allows me to advocate for this city and provide it with the tools to create a strong family-oriented community. The city is in need of its own distinct economic engine rooted in local small businesses and amenities and facilities such as a library for youth,” Yow said.</p>
		<p class="text-break fw-normal">Yow took the helm as mayor of Eastvale in December 2020 and — at the age of 25 — became the one of the youngest women to serve as mayor of a California city. </p>
		<p class="text-break fw-normal">Being a new mom to a six-month-old further fuels my passion to serve my community,” Yow said. “Local government makes decisions that affect our daily lives and is where we can directly see democracy in action. I am serving the city to ensure a better future for my son and the next generation of Eastvale residents.”</p>
